# Program: GeneratePassword

This program generates random passwords with a specified complexity and saves them to a text file or displays them in the terminal. It offers three modes of operation:

### Modes:
1. **Terminal Mode (Mode 1):**  
   The user enters their name and desired password length via the terminal, after which the program generates a password and displays it in the terminal.

2. **Terminal Mode with File Saving (Mode 2):**  
   The user enters their name and desired password length via the terminal. The program then generates a password and saves it to a text file on the desktop, adding the new password at the end of the file (with a blank line between entries).

3. **Graphical Interface Mode (Mode 3):**  
   The user enters their name, password length, and selects which characters to include in the password (letters, numbers, special characters) via a graphical interface. The program generates the password and displays it on the screen, and also offers the option to save it to a text file.
